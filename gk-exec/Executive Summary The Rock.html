				<div class="rock-content">
					
							<p>Jim Cooper was born and raised in Tennessee. He and Martha, his wife of twenty eight years, live in Nashville and have three children.</p>

							<p>A <strong>New York Times</strong> columnist recently called him <em>"the House's conscience, a lonely voice for civility in this ugly era"</em> and a <em>"tart-tongued moderate"</em> who <em>"seeks bipartisanship on fiscal matters and other issues in a polarized political climate."</em> <strong>USA Today</strong> named him one of the <em>"Brave 38" of a "tiny band of heroes"</em> in Congress for his work on a bipartisan budget plan.</p>

							<p>In Congress, he's known for his work on the federal budget, health care and government reform.</P>

				<h2>District</h2>
				<a href="#slide-1" class="rock-back">Back</a>
				<div class="rock-content">
						<strong>District 5, Tennesee</strong>
					<p>District 5, Tennesee is located slightly northwest of the state's geographical center. It is currently composed of Davidson and Dickson counties, as well as most of Cheatham County. It is the only Tennessee congressional district which does not border another state.</P>
			

					<p>The district stretches west of Nashville, and into Cheatham and Dickson counties, which are far less suburbanized than the communities to the south and east of Nashville.</p>
					<p>The 5th is historically a very safe seat for the Democratic Party, due almost entirely to the influence of heavily Democratic Nashville. Some pockets of Republican influence exist in Belle Meade, and portions of neighboring Cheatham County. However, they are no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in most of Nashville.

					No Republican has represented Nashville in Congress since Horace Harrison in 1875. </p>

					<p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell

						entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if
